# if element style defined, can override by defining a different CSS stylesheet

# Example - at top of different .erb file, call a different CSS stylesheet

# .erb file will inherit styles from stylesheet defined in layout.erb
# - styles for same element/class/id in new stylesheet will override style defined in layout.erb
